The scripts in this directory process the output data and generate figures 
which where NOT used in the final manuscript.
They have been retained for posterity, be that future revisions or if
reviewers or collaborators which to generate similar figures.

These files were previously in the parent directory and have just been moved
without checking if they still run correctly.
You will still need a `script_variables.py` file. Simply copying and pasting 
your `analyses/script_variables.py` file into this directory should do the 
trick (I think).
